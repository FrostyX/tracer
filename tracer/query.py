	Provide API for Tracer quering operations.
	They are executed kind of lazily, so running the operation will
	return just an wrapper class with ``get()`` method.

	Example::

		from tracer.query import Query
		q = Query()
		q.affected_applications().get()

	.. note::
		Some quering methods can require root permissions
