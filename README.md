# Tracer

Tracer finds outdated running applications in your system

Tracer determines which applications use outdated files and prints
them. For special kind of applications such as services or daemons, it
suggests a standard command to restart it. Detecting whether file is
outdated or not is based on a simple idea. If application has loaded
in memory any version of a file which is provided by any package
updated since system was booted up, tracer consider this application
as outdated.
